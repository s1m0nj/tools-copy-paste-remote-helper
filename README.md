 This tool enables seamless text transfer in restricted RDP sessions by watching a text file for changes. When updated, it loads the text into an AutoHotKey script, which reloads instantly, allowing pasting into RDP sessions that block copy-paste. Real-time updates and easy setup streamline data entry in secure environments.
