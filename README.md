# tools-copy-paste-remote-helper
This tool seamlessly transfers text across restricted Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions by enabling quick updates and reloads. It monitors a designated text file, and whenever changes are detected, the content is automatically transferred into an AutoHotKey (AHK) script. This script is then reloaded, allowing instant pasting of text into RDP sessions that otherwise block copy-paste functions.

Value:

- Efficient Workflow: Enables swift transfer of essential text, eliminating the usual copy-paste restrictions in RDP sessions.
- Real-time Updates: Automatically watches for changes, ensuring that the latest text is always available for pasting.
- Simple Automation: Reduces manual effort with an easy-to-implement AutoHotKey setup, perfect for frequent text updates in secure environments.

Ideal for professionals needing smooth data entry into secure or restricted RDP environments without complex setups or permissions.
